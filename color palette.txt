For an e-commerce website, it’s important to choose a color palette that not only aligns with your brand but also enhances usability, especially for both light and dark modes. Here are two distinct color palettes—one for light mode and one for dark mode—ensuring contrast, readability, and a modern, appealing look.

### **Light Mode Color Palette**:
1. **Primary Color** (for CTA buttons, highlights):
   - **Hex**: #FF6F61 (Soft Coral)
   - **Usage**: Use for buttons like “Shop Now,” “Add to Cart,” or key promotional sections.

2. **Secondary Color** (for accents and links):
   - **Hex**: #4CAF50 (Medium Green)
   - **Usage**: Use for smaller buttons, links, or price tags.

3. **Background Color**:
   - **Hex**: #FFFFFF (Pure White)
   - **Usage**: A clean, neutral background that makes products and text stand out.

4. **Card Background Color**:
   - **Hex**: #F5F5F5 (Light Gray)
   - **Usage**: Use for product cards and sections to subtly distinguish them from the background.

5. **Text Color**:
   - **Hex**: #333333 (Dark Charcoal)
   - **Usage**: Use for body text and descriptions. It’s dark enough for great readability without being as harsh as pure black.

6. **Accent Color** (for subtle elements like dividers or hover effects):
   - **Hex**: #FFC107 (Mustard Yellow)
   - **Usage**: Use for minor highlights like hover states on product images or icons.

### **Dark Mode Color Palette**:
1. **Primary Color** (for CTA buttons, highlights):
   - **Hex**: #FF8C00 (Bright Amber)
   - **Usage**: A warm, attention-grabbing color that contrasts well with a dark background.

2. **Secondary Color** (for accents and links):
   - **Hex**: #03DAC6 (Teal)
   - **Usage**: This can be used for accent elements like links or subtle highlights around key sections.

3. **Background Color**:
   - **Hex**: #121212 (Jet Black)
   - **Usage**: A deep, pure black that creates a strong contrast for your design elements.

4. **Card Background Color**:
   - **Hex**: #1E1E1E (Dark Gray)
   - **Usage**: Use for product cards, forms, and sections, to subtly lift them from the background.

5. **Text Color**:
   - **Hex**: #E0E0E0 (Light Gray)
   - **Usage**: Light gray text that’s easy to read against a dark background, without being as stark as white.

6. **Accent Color** (for minor details, like dividers or borders):
   - **Hex**: #BB86FC (Soft Purple)
   - **Usage**: Use sparingly for minor details such as borders or hover effects, adding some elegance to the design.

### **Usage Tips**:
- **Contrast**: In both light and dark modes, ensure high contrast between the text and background for readability. For example, use dark text on light backgrounds and light text on dark backgrounds.
- **Consistency**: Keep the same primary and secondary colors between both modes, so the brand identity is consistent.
- **CTAs**: Make sure your call-to-action buttons stand out by using bright, warm colors like coral or amber.
